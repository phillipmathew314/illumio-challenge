# Information:
I tested my code using print statements with different sets of information passed into the firewall object's function. I used a Python dictionary with keys attributed to direction and protocol, and values of sets of ports and IP addresses. I could have used just one set with strings containing information about the direction, protocol, port, and IP address to improve the space complexity of my solution, while keeping the time complexity of the packet search at O(1).

# Team
I am most interested in Illumio's platform team.
